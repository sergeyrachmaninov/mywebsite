                Hacking one's own home network can be quite difficult, as it involves multiple layers of security and defense mechanisms. These challenges include:
            
                - Accessibility: Many home networks are protected by a password, but these passwords are often weak or easily guessable, making it easy for attackers to gain access. 
                Additionally, many home routers have their default credentials that remain unchanged, providing an easy entry point for hackers.
            
                - Encryption: Some home networks use encryption to protect sensitive data, but even if a network is encrypted, it does not mean that all devices on the network are also secured 
                with strong passwords or other security measures.
            
                - Outdated software and firmware: Many home devices such as routers and internet of things (IoT) devices have outdated software and firmware versions that lack security 
                patches, making them vulnerable to attacks.
            
                To overcome these challenges, I had to employ a variety of techniques and tools. Firstly, I used a tool called Wireshark to capture packets on my home network. This 
                helped me identify weaknesses in my home network's security such as vulnerable ports or open WiFi connections that could be exploited by attackers. Secondly, I used a tool 
                called Nmap to scan my network for any live hosts and services running on it. This allowed me to identify potential targets like file servers or web servers that I could 
                exploit to gain access to the network.
            
                Thirdly, I used a tool called Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities found during the scanning process. Metasploit is an open-source framework that allows penetration testers
                to create custom payloads for exploiting vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. By using this tool, I was able to gain access to my home network through 
                various methods such as SQL injection or buffer overflow attacks.
            
                Finally, I used a tool called Burp Suite to intercept and analyze all traffic on my home network. This helped me identify any weaknesses in the security of my web applications 
                that could be exploited by attackers. For example, I found that some of my web applications were using outdated versions of PHP or had vulnerabilities such as XSS 
                attacks.
            
                Throughout the process, I made several noteworthy discoveries about my home network's security. Firstly, I discovered that many devices on my home network were running with 
                default passwords which meant attackers could easily gain access to them using brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks. Secondly, I found that my home network had no
                password protecting it which allowed any unauthorized user within range of the WiFi connection to connect without authentication.
            
                Overall, hacking my own home network for educational purposes was a valuable experience that taught me a lot about home network security. By using various tools and techniques,
                I was able to identify weaknesses in my home network's security such as vulnerable ports or open WiFi connections that could be exploited by attackers. However, it also 
                highlighted the importance of having strong passwords, enabling encryption on your network, and regularly updating software and firmware to ensure maximum protection 
                against potential threats.
