		    <h2>Summary</h2>
	            <p>A dedicated professional currently transitioning from a background in telemarketing to a career in Information Technology (IT). 
		    With a strong passion for problem-solving and a knack for learning new technologies, I am eager to leverage my skills and enthusiasm to make a positive impact in the IT industry. 
		    My journey into IT began with self-directed learning and online courses, where I gained foundational knowledge in programming languages such as Bash, Python, and Java. 
		    I am currently expanding my skillset through hands-on projects and further education in areas such as network administration, software engineering, and data analytics. 
		    My career goals in IT include pursuing a role as a Network Administrator, obtaining certifications like CompTIA Linux+, and learning to program in GO. 
		    I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the dynamic field of Information Technology. 
		    Education: Currently, I attend the University of Rochester and have sophomore standing. My intended major is Computer Science and my intended minor is Biology. 
		    In my time as a student, I have made the President's List (4.0) on two separate occassions 
		    ( <a href="https://www.collin.edu/news/2022/01/12/collin-college-announces-fall-2021-presidents-list.html">Fall 2021</a> ) while being a member of both the Robotics Club and the 
		    Wrestling/Judo Club. Hobbies: I am an advocate for the Keto, Low Carb, and Carnivore diets. Exercise is a passion of mine, so I regularly engage in resistance training and enjoy 
		    going on long hikes with my dogs whenever the weather permits. I maintain interest in subjects like philosophy, classical literature, and chemistry which gives me plenty of time 
		    to read when I'm not working or studying.</p>
