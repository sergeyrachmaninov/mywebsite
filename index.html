	        <div class="about-description">
	            <p>I am Austin McMurry, a dedicated professional currently transitioning from a background in telemarketing to a career in Information Technology (IT). With a strong passion for problem-solving and a knack for learning new technologies, I am eager to leverage my skills and enthusiasm to make a positive impact in the IT industry. My journey into IT began with self-directed learning and online courses, where I gained foundational knowledge in programming languages such as Bash, Python, and Java. I am currently expanding my skillset through hands-on projects and further education in areas such as network administration, software engineering, and data analytics. My career goals in IT include pursuing a role as a Security Tools Engineer, obtaining certifications like CompTIA Linux+, and learning to program in GO. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the dynamic field of Information Technology. Education: Currently, I attend the University of Rochester and hold the status of sophomore. My intended major is Computer Science and my intended minor is Biology. In my time as a student, I have made the President's List (4.0) on two separate occassions (receipts) while being a member of both the Robotics Club and the Wrestling/Judo Club. Hobbies: I am an advocate for the Keto, Low Carb, and Carnivore diets. Exercise is a passion of mine, so I resistance train as much as I can and go on hikes with my dogs whenever the weather allows it. I maintain interest in subjects like philosophy, classical literature, and chemistry which gives me plenty of time to read when I'm not working or studying.</p>
